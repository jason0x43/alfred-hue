An Alfred workflow for controlling Hue lights

Installation
------------

Download the workflow package and double click it -- Alfred will take care of the rest.

Usage
-----

Access the workflow using the keyword `hue`. The first time the keyword is used, only the `hub` item will be available. Selecting this item will allow you to choose a hub and step you through connecting to it. Once you've connected to a hub, you can control individual lights.

Using the `meethue` command you can login to your MeetHue.com account. Once you’ve logged in a `sync` command will become available. This command will download any scenes you’ve synced from your mobile devices.
